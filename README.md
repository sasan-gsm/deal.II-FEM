# deal.II FEM
one-dimensional finite element code in C++ using the deal.II FEM library frameswork and the template provided to solve the given problem, following these requirements:
 Code (a) linear, (b) quadratic and (c) cubic order Lagrange polynomial basis functions.
 Include a function to calculate the L2 norm of the error between the finite element solution (uh) with
the exact solution (u), given by sqrt((u - uh)2 dx).
 All integration in Klocal, Flocal, and the L2 norm of the error should be done by Gaussian quadrature.
 A 100 element mesh is used.
